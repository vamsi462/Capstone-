# Work-Finder Capstone Project

## Problem Statement:
Daily wage workers who are playing a key role in India’s economy,having difficulties in finding 
work.Daily wage workers who will have temporary work for a period of time, once it is completed
they have to search for a new job and it takes a number of days for finding the new work and 
earning money. So in this whole process it is taking a much time to find a new work and earn 
money for their needs 

## solution:
Here is the process where we can reduce the gap between the previous work and new work of 
daily wage workers and make them to save time and energy.
 We are going to develop an application which acts as a bridge between the work providers and 
daily wage workers. In this the work provider and daily wage workers both register in the 
application according to their roles and initially the work provider will raise a request for workers 
for the work which to be completed.Now the daily wage workers will get notified about the work 
which is available based on work provider location.After that the workers quotes a charge 
according to the work to be done and finally the work completed.this way the workers can find 
new works easily without wasting time and energy and it also saves time for the work provider 
by going out and find the daily wage workers for the work.
